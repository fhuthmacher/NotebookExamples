    "This notebook demonstrates how **_large language models, such as Flan T5 XL,accessible via SamgeMaker JumpStart_** interact with AWS databases, data stores, and third-party data warehousing solutions like Snowflake. We showcase this interaction 1) by generating and running SQL queries, and 2) making requests to API endpoints. We achieve all of this by using the LangChain framework, which allows the language model to interact with its environment and connect with other sources of data. The LangChain framework operates based on the following principles: calling out to a language model, being data-aware, and being agentic. Our notebook focuses on establishing database connections to various data sources, consolidating metadata, and returning fact-based data points in response to user queries using LLMs and LangChain."
